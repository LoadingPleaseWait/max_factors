Compile:
make

Run:
bin/max_factors a b k n

**The program should be compiled and run on the same machine.**
**The program needs ~16 GiB of memory to compile**
**It looks like there is a bug in the gcc which you may run into during compilation. If compilation fails, please just run make again and it should work :)**
